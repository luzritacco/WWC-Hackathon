+ **Problem:** Without an organized shopping- list, it’s easy to forget what you need and buy items that you don’t need. This can lead to overspending and waste time and money. Moreover, without an organized shopping list can be overwhelming, especially if you’re shopping for a large family or for a special occasion.

•	**The WWC Hackathon** was a great experience for us, as it was our first time participating in such an event. We had the chance to work with amazing professionals from different backgrounds and fields. The hackathon challenged us to be creative and think outside the box, as we had to come up with a project idea and implement it within a limited time frame. We also learned how to manage our time and prioritize our tasks effectively, as we had to balance between coding, testing, and presenting our project.
